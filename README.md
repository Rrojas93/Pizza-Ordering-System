# Pizza-Ordering-System
Small Windows Forms Project for Intro to Software Engineering course. 

The purpose of this project was to create a pizza ordering system for a pizza shop. The user (Cashier/Employee of the shop) would be able to create an order for delivery or pick up and be able to store and retrieve customer information from a database. The system would also generate a receipt of the order including totals, order type (delivery/pick up), and payment types (credit card, cash, or check). The GUI was created using Windows Forms.
